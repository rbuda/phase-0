#Think About Time

I felt the Counter-Intuitive article spoke to me the most.  Many of its' concepts are completely opposite of what I was trained in the sales world i.e. what you've done vs how you feel.  Most jobs are all about what you've done today versus programming is did you get better or learn a new task.  I am very familiar with Time Boxing as a friend in the industry sent me articles about Pomodoro technique earlier this year.  I used it while on Codecademy and it works from the standpoint of being less burned out and having the info stick.  I still use it except I deviate from the 25 minutes.  This strategy is working except I did pull a good tidbit from the first video "Create a Habit" when he talked about the campaign manager who started at 3pm and worked til 4am.  I don't have trouble with mornings THAT much but I struggle when I don't make lists.  I grew up on a chore list from mom everyday and read that people who rely on lists are less likely to remember things without them.  Trying to go without lists was a failure and I'm a half-week into planning my day the night before.  Overall plan for Phase 0 is to primarily stay on schedule but to forget everything I know about HTML, CSS, command line & etc so I can learn the same way my classmates are. 

## The Command Line

Shell is the interpreter for users to type commands.  Bash is a type of shell that was shown to save a user's profile settings.  It is another command language.  
The toughest part was the input, output and |'ing examples.  I know data streams are going to be one of the most important parts of using the command line since creating and editing files restrains the user to doing only so much.  I was able to follow along and play with some concepts on my own computer - still need to read into data streams more.
I would guess the most important commands to know are vi, man, grep, chmod, ls, kill.  vi is important in creating and editing files, man opens up all the commands allowing the user to NOT have to memorize everything, grep gives way to searching files easier, chmod  allows the user to change permissions which would be very important in any IT setting and ls shows the status of files' permission.  Kill would be important in an IT setting when a CPU's % is overclocking.
pwd - print working directory, shows file path
ls - lists info about file, permission string, user, group
mv - either renames file or moves to another directory
cd - changes directory, typed by itself will send user to home directory
../ - following cd will move the user up in the directory
touch - doesn't change file just updates the date and time when running the ls -l cmd on the file
mkdir - make directory, makes a new folder path
less - allows user to look at one page at a time of the opened file i.e. less hello.txt
rmdir - removes/deletes directory 
rm - removes/deletes file
help - opens list of common commands
