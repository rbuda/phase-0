// Release 1: Create your user stories

// Create a new list
// Add an item with a quantity to the list
// Remove an item from the list
// Update quantities for items in your list
// Print the list (Consider how to make it look nice!)

// Release 2: Pseudocode

///////// Array or Object??

// Determine which data structure you should use for your grocery list based on these requirements. Does an array or an object the most sense and why?

// Remember to keep your pseudocode in plain English and write it so that it's easy to translate to your initial solution. Identify the input and output. Your pseudocode should also avoid using language-specific words, include proper indentation, and capitalize keywords like IF, WHILE, etc.)

///// Input
///// Output



// Release 3: Initial Solution

// Using your pseudocode, create your initial solution. If you've spent the time to write your pseudocode in enough detail, this should be relatively easy.

// Remember, your initial solution should not include any special JavaScript methods. Keep the logic basic so you can incorporate fun methods when you refactor!





// Release 4: Refactor

// Now go into the Docs to see if there are any methods you can simplify your code with. Also refactor for readability. Keep in mind, although one-line solutions look neat, they aren't necessarily the most efficient or "best" code. 










// Release 5: Reflect

// Create a commented reflection section in your "review.js" file. In it answer the following questions:

// What concepts did you solidify in working on this challenge? (reviewing the passing of information, objects, constructors, etc.)

// What was the most difficult part of this challenge?

// Did an array or object make more sense to use and why?
