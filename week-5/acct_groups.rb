# Input: List of names(cohort)
# Output : Groups of no less than 3, no more than 5 made from the list array cohort, ideally 4-5 per group

# Steps to complete:
# See if cohort is divisible by 5 or 4
# create a new hash
# test if group is divisible by 5 and 4
# find remainder of group when divided by 4 or 5
# go through array and assign 5 or 4 members to a key (group number)
# add one to group number for each set of 4 or 5 members
# add remaining people to groups
# print groups out with keys as group number and hashes as each member

# 3 Refactor

# Didn't have success refactoring down

# 4 Reflection

# What was the most interesting and most difficult part of this challenge?
# Getting the remainder of members into a group.

# Do you feel you are improving in your ability to write pseudocode and break the problem down?
# Yes. I am writing pseudocode as I'm running into new problems and it's helping to go back to what I had and add to it.

# Was your approach for automating this task a good solution? What could have made it even better?
# My inital approach was to keep it all in an array and set arrays within an array.  Hashes were ultimately easier.

# What data structure did you decide to store the accountability groups in and why?
# Hash.  Was easier to put each member with a key that would be their group number.

# What did you learn in the process of refactoring your initial solution? Did you learn any new Ruby methods?
# Didn't get anything out of the refactoring.  Curious what others did.
