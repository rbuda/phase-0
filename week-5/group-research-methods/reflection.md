What was your experience like researching for Ruby methods. Did you find them quickly? How easy was it to implement once you found one? Very easy as my projects title had the method name I needed to use in it (sort),\.

Did you find any methods you thought would work but didn't? What made you think they would work? How did you determine they didn't? I thought that I would have to make source destructive.  I couldn't get it to return the correct value so instead created a new array.

How does the method you chose iterate through and modify information in a data structure? It does a .sort_by on the source looking at a variable or key,value and then sees which order I want it in (i.e. integer to strings or values).

Is the method you implemented destructive or non-destructive? non-destructive

What did you learn from reading your accountability-group member's explanations on their solutions?

What did you learn about researching and explaining your research to others? That I should give them alternate ways to manupulate the method if you wanted different results than what the spec file wants.
