What this will offer is a need the business didn't fully know it had but will soon recognize once it has it.

This website will engage the user unlike any other local area business.  It is the only responsive website in the entire field in the area.  Users will have the option to communicate with the business three different ways.  Users will now feel they've already been to the location and meet the staff even when they have not.
