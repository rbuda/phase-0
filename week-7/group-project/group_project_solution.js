// As a user, I want to be able to take a set of numbers and perform three different functions separately: sum, mean, and median. This set of numbers can have either an even or odd amount of integers. With sum, I want add all the numbers together. With mean, I want to find the average of all the numbers. With median, I want to find the middlemost number. If the set of numbers has an even amount of integers, find the average of the two middlemost numbers.

// Pseudocode:
// Create 2 sets of numbers (arrays) - each with its' own variable
// One variable has odd set of numbers other has even set
// 
// Create function called "sum"
//  This function will take in an array as an argument
//  Within the function (inside {}'s) set a counter variable equal to 0
//  Set a variable length equal to the array's length
//  Set a variable called "sum" equal to 0
//  Set a for-loop condition that will continue on if counter < length
//  Modify the sum variable to add a number from the array on each iteration, add 1 to the counter
//  Return the total sum within the console.log to check answers.
// 
// Create function called "mean" (exact same as above but adding in one variable at the end)
//  This function will take in an array as an argument
//  Within the function (inside {}'s) set a counter variable equal to 0
//  Set a variable length equal to the array's length
//  Set a variable called "sum" equal to 0
//  Set a for-loop condition that will continue on if counter < length
//  Modify the sum variable to add a number from the array on each iteration, add 1 to the counter
//  *** Create var called avg and set to sum divided by length of array
//  Return the total avg within the console.log to check answers.

// Create function called "median"
//  This function takes an array as an argument
//  Create a variable "middle" equal to the array's length divided by 2.  Make sure this number is rounded down.
//  IF array's length is odd return array[middle]
//  ELSE array's length is even return both array[middle] and [middle - 1]
