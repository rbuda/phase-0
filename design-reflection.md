		<h1>What are the 6 Phases of Web Design? Information Gathering, Planning, Design, Development, Testing & Delivery, Maintenance</h1>
		<h1>What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature? Website will be a snapshot of my knowledge and work portfolio.  Will have links and snapshots to websites and design work I've done, a blog to show what I'm learning and can comfortably share and contact information.</h1>
		<h1>What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them? Their interests will be to get a deeper look at my resume of work and possibly to learn a thing or two about web development from the blog.</h1>
		<h1>What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors. 
		Portfolio first to establish credibility and then search for information and contacting me.</h1>
		<h1>What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?</h1>
		<h1>What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 
		Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious? UX is science behind a user's experience with using a website i.e. how quickly they can find something or make a purchase.  It is valuable since the user will put up with very little resistance when it comes to load time, making a purchase etc.  If the UX is awful the company will struggle with sales online or having steady traffic come back again.</h1>
