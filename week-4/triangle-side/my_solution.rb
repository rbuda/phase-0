# I worked on this challenge Ryan Nebuda

=begin
	
Write a method valid_triangle? which takes as its input three 
non-negative numbers. It should return true if the three numbers 
could form the side lengths of a triangle and false otherwise.

The arguments don't correspond to specific sides. 
Don't worry about handling negative inputs â€” garbage in gets 
garbage out.

Note: When you see a method that has a ? in its name, that
 means the expected result is a boolean value. It should 
 return true or false. Keep this in mind when working through 
 later challenges or writing your own challenges.

For example,

valid_triangle?(0,0,0) # => false, because a triangle can't 
have 0-length sides

valid_triangle?(1,1,1) # => true, an equilateral triangle

valid_triangle?(3,4,5) # => true, a right triangle
valid_triangle?(4,3,5) # => true, the same right triangle
valid_triangle?(5,3,4) # => true, the same right triangle

	
=end

# Your Solution Below

def valid_triangle?(a, b, c)
  # Your code goes here!
  # can't have a zero side
  # a + b > c
  # a + c > b
  # b + c > a
  # a = b = c 

  if (a == 0 or b == 0 or c == 0)
  	#puts "no zeroes!!"
  	return false
  elsif (a+b>c and a+c>b and b+c>a)
  	return true
  else
  	return false
  end
