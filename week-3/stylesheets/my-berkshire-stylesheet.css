/*******************
What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file? put a link href="" in the html file within the <head>.  

What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? Padding is great for seperation & W3 Schools has excellent resources.  Giving div id's is a great way to work a specified area's format.

What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.) border-top, color with hex colors.

Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you choose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML? I created a legal
and geico id.  The geico section needed special formating and the legal did as well.

When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?  The actual website has formatting
within the HTML file versus all in a CSS file.  Having the HTML file handle content only and css styling only shapes up for cleaner code.
