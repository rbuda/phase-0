#A wireframe is an outline of what a site's layout and basic content areas will look like.  It is to keep the developer on track to what the end result should look close to.

#Wireframing is great for teams and individuals.  Teams can figure out together what a website's page should look like before creating its' code and going in different directions.  Individuals will take less trips down the rabbit hole as wireframing focuses their attention on matching their initial wireframes blueprint.

#It was tough as my internet situation was difficult and I ended up using notebook paper.  I use scratch paper all the time but would've enjoyed trying a wireframe tool for it.  Will revist soon.

#Stuck with my first idea.  Have done websites before so had a basic understanding of what I wanted it to look like.

#Explored git resources as my repo was set to go to another repository on GitHub.  Had to switch push paths.

#The two websites I've done I did not use wireframing.  I like to go a 100 mph and prefer to just jump in.  This was good to slow down and put a blueprint together which will help me more in team environments.
